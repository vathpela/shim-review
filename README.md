This repo is for review of requests for signing shim.  To create a request for review:

- clone this repo
- edit the template below
- add the shim.efi to be signed
- add build logs
- add any additional binaries/certificates/SHA256 hashes that may be needed
- commit all of that
- tag it with a tag of the form "myorg-shim-arch-YYYYMMDD"
- push that to github
- file an issue at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues with a link to your tag
- approval is ready when the "accepted" label is added to your issue

Note that we really only have experience with using GRUB2 or systemd-boot on Linux, so
asking us to endorse anything else for signing is going to require some convincing on
your part.

Check the docs directory in this repo for guidance on submission and
getting your shim signed.

Here's the template:

*******************************************************************************
### What organization or people are asking to have this signed?
*******************************************************************************
Red Hat, Inc.

*******************************************************************************
### What product or service is this for?
*******************************************************************************
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

*******************************************************************************
### What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it?
*******************************************************************************
We're a major bigtime OS vendor

*******************************************************************************
### Why are you unable to reuse shim from another distro that is already signed?
*******************************************************************************
RHEL 9 has a different set of trusted certificates than previous versions.

*******************************************************************************
### Who is the primary contact for security updates, etc.?
The security contacts need to be verified before the shim can be accepted. For subsequent requests, contact verification is only necessary if the security contacts or their PGP keys have changed since the last successful verification.

An authorized reviewer will initiate contact verification by sending each security contact a PGP-encrypted email containing random words.
You will be asked to post the contents of these mails in your `shim-review` issue to prove ownership of the email addresses and PGP keys.

- PGP key fingerprint: B00B 48BC 731A A884 0FED  9FB0 EED2 66B7 0F4F EF10

(Key should be signed by the other security contacts, pushed to a keyserver
like keyserver.ubuntu.com, and preferably have signatures that are reasonably
well known in the Linux community.)

*******************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************
### Were these binaries created from the 15.8 shim release tar?
Please create your shim binaries starting with the 15.8 shim release tar file: https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.8/shim-15.8.tar.bz2

This matches https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.8 and contains the appropriate gnu-efi source.

*******************************************************************************
Yes, these were created from that tarball.

*******************************************************************************
### URL for a repo that contains the exact code which was built to get this binary:
*******************************************************************************
https://github.com/rhboot/shim/tree/15.8

*******************************************************************************
### What patches are being applied and why:
*******************************************************************************
None

*******************************************************************************
### Do you have the NX bit set in your shim? If so, is your entire boot stack NX-compatible and what testing have you done to ensure such compatibility?

See https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/hardware-dev-center/nx-exception-for-shim-community/ba-p/3976522 for more details on the signing of shim without NX bit.
*******************************************************************************
It's not set.

*******************************************************************************
### If shim is loading GRUB2 bootloader what exact implementation of Secureboot in GRUB2 do you have? (Either Upstream GRUB2 shim_lock verifier or Downstream RHEL/Fedora/Debian/Canonical-like implementation)
*******************************************************************************
This is a "RHEL-like" implementation.

*******************************************************************************
### If shim is loading GRUB2 bootloader and your previously released shim booted a version of GRUB2 affected by any of the CVEs in the July 2020, the March 2021, the June 7th 2022, the November 15th 2022, or 3rd of October 2023 GRUB2 CVE list, have fixes for all these CVEs been applied?

*******************************************************************************
The current builds include the grub,4 fixes

*******************************************************************************
### If shim is loading GRUB2 bootloader, and if these fixes have been applied, is the upstream global SBAT generation in your GRUB2 binary set to 4?
The entry should look similar to: `grub,4,Free Software Foundation,grub,GRUB_UPSTREAM_VERSION,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/`
*******************************************************************************
The current builds include the grub,4 fixes

*******************************************************************************
### Were old shims hashes provided to Microsoft for verification and to be added to future DBX updates?
### Does your new chain of trust disallow booting old GRUB2 builds affected by the CVEs?
*******************************************************************************
Yes and yes.

*******************************************************************************
### If your boot chain of trust includes a Linux kernel:
### Is upstream commit [1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e "efi: Restrict efivar_ssdt_load when the kernel is locked down"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e) applied?
### Is upstream commit [75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354 "ACPI: configfs: Disallow loading ACPI tables when locked down"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354) applied?
### Is upstream commit [eadb2f47a3ced5c64b23b90fd2a3463f63726066 "lockdown: also lock down previous kgdb use"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eadb2f47a3ced5c64b23b90fd2a3463f63726066) applied?
*******************************************************************************
All of the following commits are present:

475fb4e8b2f4444d1d7b406ff3a7d21bc89a1e6f
1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e

435d1a471598752446a72ad1201b3c980526d869

And the configuration setting CONFIG_EFI_CUSTOM_SSDT_OVERLAYS is disabled.

*******************************************************************************
### Do you build your signed kernel with additional local patches? What do they do?
*******************************************************************************
Far too many to explain here.  RHEL actively backports features and bugfixes.

*******************************************************************************
### Do you use an ephemeral key for signing kernel modules?
### If not, please describe how you ensure that one kernel build does not load modules built for another kernel.
*******************************************************************************
Yes.

*******************************************************************************
### If you use vendor_db functionality of providing multiple certificates and/or hashes please briefly describe your certificate setup.
### If there are allow-listed hashes please provide exact binaries for which hashes are created via file sharing service, available in public with anonymous access for verification.
*******************************************************************************
vendor_db contains redhatsecurebootca5.cer and redhatsecurebootca8.cer, which
are included in this repository.

*******************************************************************************
### If you are re-using a previously used (CA) certificate, you will need to add the hashes of the previous GRUB2 binaries exposed to the CVEs to vendor_dbx in shim in order to prevent GRUB2 from being able to chainload those older GRUB2 binaries. If you are changing to a new (CA) certificate, this does not apply.
### Please describe your strategy.
*******************************************************************************
This build requires .sbat support, and that's already in all of the fixed grub2
builds but none of the pre-CVE ones.

*******************************************************************************
### What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build?  Include where to find it, etc.  We're going to try to reproduce your build as closely as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
### If the shim binaries can't be reproduced using the provided Dockerfile, please explain why that's the case and what the differences would be.
*******************************************************************************
This is built on RHEL 9.  The Dockerfile in this repository can be used to
launch an identical buildroot.

*******************************************************************************
### Which files in this repo are the logs for your build?
This should include logs for creating the buildroots, applying patches, doing the build, creating the archives, etc.
*******************************************************************************
root.log and build.log

*******************************************************************************
### What changes were made in the distor's secure boot chain since your SHIM was last signed?
For example, signing new kernel's variants, UKI, systemd-boot, new certs, new CA, etc..
*******************************************************************************
No structural changes other than updates to shim and grub

*******************************************************************************
### What is the SHA256 hash of your final SHIM binary?
*******************************************************************************
$ sha256sum shimx64.efi
d7ac3a63b380128cf3ceb2545f56caf4688c16329332c2d5dac537f787031585  shimx64.efi
$ pesign -h -P -i shimx64.efi
27b12463e599b3147635f272e3722960e443def60fef088eba600697017529f2 shimx64.efi

*******************************************************************************
### How do you manage and protect the keys used in your SHIM?
*******************************************************************************
The keys are in an HSM managed by our PSIRT team, builders talk to it over
https using gssapi for authentication, and each key is authorized for use by
specific tickets, the issuing of which is protected by ACLs for the user, the
package being built, and the build target.

*******************************************************************************
### Do you use EV certificates as embedded certificates in the SHIM?
*******************************************************************************
No.

*******************************************************************************
### Do you add a vendor-specific SBAT entry to the SBAT section in each binary that supports SBAT metadata ( GRUB2, fwupd, fwupdate, systemd-boot, systemd-stub, shim + all child shim binaries )?
### Please provide exact SBAT entries for all SBAT binaries you are booting or planning to boot directly through shim.
### Where your code is only slightly modified from an upstream vendor's, please also preserve their SBAT entries to simplify revocation.
If you are using a downstream implementation of GRUB2 or systemd-boot (e.g.
from Fedora or Debian), please preserve the SBAT entry from those distributions
and only append your own. More information on how SBAT works can be found
[here](https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md).

*******************************************************************************
### If you are using systemd-boot on arm64 or riscv, is the fix for [unverified Devicetree Blob loading](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/security/advisories/GHSA-6m6p-rjcq-334c) included?
*******************************************************************************
We don't currently get shim signed for those arches.

*******************************************************************************
### What is the origin and full version number of your bootloader (GRUB2 or systemd-boot or other)?
*******************************************************************************
grub2-2.06-73.el9

*******************************************************************************
### If your SHIM launches any other components, please provide further details on what is launched.
*******************************************************************************
It also launches fwupd, sbat details are above.

*******************************************************************************
### If your GRUB2 or systemd-boot launches any other binaries that are not the Linux kernel in SecureBoot mode, please provide further details on what is launched and how it enforces Secureboot lockdown.
*******************************************************************************
grub2 verifies signatures on booted kernels via shim. fwupd does not include
code to launch other binaries, it can only load UEFI Capsule updates.

*******************************************************************************
### How do the launched components prevent execution of unauthenticated code?
*******************************************************************************
Everything has secure boot validation and and .sbat self checks.

*******************************************************************************
### Does your SHIM load any loaders that support loading unsigned kernels (e.g. GRUB2)?
*******************************************************************************
No.

*******************************************************************************
### What kernel are you using? Which patches does it includes to enforce Secure Boot?
*******************************************************************************
Currently it's kernel-5.14.0-418.el9.  It has all the patches we've previously discussed.

*******************************************************************************
### Add any additional information you think we may need to validate this shim.
