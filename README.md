This repo is for shim audit requests for signing.

Here's how to do it:

- Clone it
- Run: ./make-my-branch -r $repourl -t $tagname $ESPNAME-$product-$version-$YYYYMMDD
  Where:
|variable|meaning|
|------|------|
| $repourl | the url of your git repo
| $tagname | the name of the tag or branch that your patches are on
| $ESPNAME | who you are in a very basic form.  Basically your EFI System Partition directory reservation in lower case.  For Red Hat, it's "redhat", etc.  For Debain, it's "debian", etc.
| $product | simple name of the product this is for; for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it's "rhel"; for debian it might be "jessie".  You get the idea.
| $version | which release this is for, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux it's "7.4", for example.
| $YYYYMMDD | the current date when you're doing this.
